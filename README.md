My first Milestone Project for Code Institute is a website about a historical figure called Nikola Tesla. This is my first Project and therefore I am not quite sure how I should structure this document or the webiste. The site currently is single page and it features the header, facts,and contact us sections. Thw responsiveness of the site is not 100% nor is the documentation. Please reach out with any comments you might have.
